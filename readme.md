## TF2-RenderDemo-Batcher

This application generates batch files for use with https://github.com/juniorsgithub/tf2-renderdemo. The application reads the killstreak event logs and automatically exports uncompressed clips of the killstreaks. 

Currently you should probably just modify the settings.json with the info that requires and edit the code to tweak tick offsets and such. I will finish the configurability of this if there is interest, right now it works for me.
